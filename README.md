# Server-side-with-Angular

A `server-side web application` for a news service using a `PHP backend` and an `Angular frontend`. Some users add or update news and others just view news. News are saved on a database and they have the following characteristics: text of the news, title, producer, date, category (politics, society, health etc.). The user who adds or updates news must log in using a username and password before doing this (user is automatically redirected to login page). The other type of users can see all the news from a range of dates and all news from a specific category. Also, on the news browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. date range, category), is displayed.
